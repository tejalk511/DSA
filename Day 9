Day 9 - Modified Binary search
Using binary search 
 
Question 1 - Find target element in rotated sorted arr
https://leetcode.com/problems/search-in-rotated-sorted-array/description/
hint:
- 1) using start and end points find pivot: from where the array is rotated: we will get this at "start"
- 2) Compare if target lies in 1st half or 2nd half of the rotated sorted array
- 3) Using normal binary search final the index of target element exist or not. 


Question2 - Find smallest element in rotated sorted arr
https://leetcode.com/problems/find-minimum-in-rotated-sorted-array/submissions/1633854998/
Hint:
- Same as step:1) from question 1 .
- *****Catch**** : Check if arr[start] < arr[end] --> then return arr[end] --> check this always before setting the mid 


Question3 - Find element in 2D sorted matrix
https://leetcode.com/problems/search-a-2d-matrix-ii/description/
Hint:
- Since row are sorted --> first find row where the element is present --> using binary search --> log(row)
- If row found, then search in row(col wise) if element is present or not --> using binary search --> log(col) 
- Total TC = log(row) + log(col)

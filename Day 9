Question 1 - Find target element in rotated sorted arr
https://leetcode.com/problems/search-in-rotated-sorted-array/description/
hint:
- 1) using start and end points find pivot: from where the array is rotated: we will get this at "start"
- 2) Compare if target lies in 1st half or 2nd half of the rotated sorted array
- 3) Using normal binary search final the index of target element exist or not.

https://leetcode.com/problems/find-minimum-in-rotated-sorted-array/submissions/1633854998/
Hint:
- Same as step:1) from question 1 .
- *****Catch**** : Check if arr[start] < arr[end] --> then return arr[end] --> check this always before setting the mid

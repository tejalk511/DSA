Pattern - Graphs - DFS


Problem 1- Clone Graph 

Problem 2 - Path Sum II
Find target sum in the tree --> go from root to leaf 
--> Do dfs traversal from root to leaf
--> backtracking 
--> Store a) Sum + b) Path --> so to compare at leave node. 

Problem 3 - Course Schedule II
Find schedule of course
Hint - 
--> Kahn's algo
--> topological sort -> for directed graphs using dfs
--> graph problem

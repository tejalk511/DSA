Pattern - Monotonic Stack 

Question - Next Greater Element 1
- 2 arr given : Find next greater of arr1 element by refering arr2
https://leetcode.com/problems/next-greater-element-i/
Hint:
- brute force = n^2
- Reduce to TC = O(n)
- Use index/dic to map to arr1
- Use stack to find next greater element in arr2 and map back using index/dic

Question 2 - Daily Temperature : Find after how many number of days will the temperature be greater than current day's temperature
https://leetcode.com/problems/daily-temperatures/submissions/1621893375/
Hint -
- Use stack 
- No need dict to maintain indexes -- it would lead to error is duplicate temperatures are present
- in stack store [value, index/day] for each temperature

Question 3 - Largest rectange in histogram 
https://www.naukri.com/code360/problems/largest-rectangle-in-a-histogram_1058184?leftPanelTabValue=SUBMISSION
Hint -
- Find next smaller element arr for given arr
- Find prev smaller element arr for given arr
- Rect = (nxt smaller - prev smaller -1 ) * (arr[i]) --> find max amongst all values of array

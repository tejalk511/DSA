Pattern 8 : Overlapping Intervals 
- Given arr are sorted by start time 
[a,b] & [c,d] --> Overlap if b >= c


Concept/Example - 
Problem Statement: Merge all overlapping intervals.
Example:
Input: intervals = [[1, 3], [2, 6], [8, 10], [15, 18]]
Output: [[1, 6], [8, 10], [15, 18]]

Explanation:
Sort the intervals by their start time.
Create an empty list called merged to store the merged intervals.
Iterate through the intervals and check if it overlaps with the last interval in the merged list.
If it overlaps, merge the intervals by updating the end time of the last interval in merged.
If it does not overlap, simply add the current interval to the merged list.

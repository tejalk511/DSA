Pattern 8 : Overlapping Intervals 
- Given arr are sorted by start time 
[a,b] & [c,d] --> Overlap if b >= c


Concept/Example - 
Problem Statement: Merge all overlapping intervals.
Example:
Input: intervals = [[1, 3], [2, 6], [8, 10], [15, 18]]
Output: [[1, 6], [8, 10], [15, 18]]

Explanation:
Sort the intervals by their start time.
Create an empty list called merged to store the merged intervals.
Iterate through the intervals and check if it overlaps with the last interval in the merged list.
If it overlaps, merge the intervals by updating the end time of the last interval in merged.
If it does not overlap, simply add the current interval to the merged list.

Question 1 - Merge Intervals
https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-intervals/
Hint:
Similar to above example


Question 2 - Insert new interval + merge overlapping intervals
https://leetcode.com/problems/insert-interval/
Hint:
Complexity = O(n)
- Single for loop and it should handle for 3 cases - 
- case 1 - new interval(end time ) < intervals(start time) --> append at start
- case 2 - new interval (start time) > intervals(end time) --> append at end of interval
- case 3- else overlapping case

PAttern - BFS

Question 1 - Rotten oranges 
Calc in how much time because of one rotten orange, others will also get rotten .
Given - 2D matrix
https://leetcode.com/problems/rotting-oranges/description/
Hint:
- Perform BFS
- Use queue
- Keep track of fresh oranges and time --> fresh oranges == 0 at end then return time else -1
- pop on at a time from queue and ppush the next rotten orange
- check in 4 directions for next rotten orange
- TRICK: while poping from queue, inside while --> use for loop --> so that 2 rotten oranges can continuously perform bfs. 



Question 2 - BFS
Find BFS traversal of the given tree
https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-level-order-traversal/description/
Hint - 
- use queue --> push root element in queue
- while queue is empty - pop element from front of queue and add it's left and right child into the tree
- TRICK: To remove elements at same level, at a time - use for loop inside the while loop of q

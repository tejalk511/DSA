Pattern - Sliding window pattern 


Question 1 - LC : 643. Maximum Average Subarray I
Hint: iterate through array sliding window, at each pt find max and at end return max. 


Question 2 - LC : 76. Minimum Window Substring (Very Interesting)
https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-window-substring/description/
Hint: 
- left and right ptr for sliding window 
- maintain two hash tables (1: for target string count, 2: current window count-to check how many element from target string are present)
- right ptr increment --> and update the hash tables
- if count of both hash tables match 
  --> check window size and update min window everytime 
  --> increment left pointer & update hash tables
- complexity = O(n^2)
